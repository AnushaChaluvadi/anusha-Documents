# _**Sprint-Prep-Checklist:**_

 -   Sprint approvals team is will work on creating a pool of approved sprints. Other content-delivery teams will pick up approved sprints from this pool
    
 -   List of activities - in the same order - for `sprints-prep` team
 
 -  -   create a project tracker
        
    -   Extract source-title, source-URL, and length-of-video and send it for select/reject_for_extraction
        
    -   1. We need to watch the video, while watching the video topics changed for a few slides we need to take the time stamp after one topic completed  
        2. We can identify the topics with heading, main titles  
        3. The minimum duration of the split video is 10 minutes (10 minutes approx)  
        Each video should not be more than 15 minutes, Exactly 10 minutes is not required.  
        don't split the video less than 9 to 10 minutes  
        don't split the video more than15 minutes  
        4. List out the timestamps and split the video into small parts based on that timestamps  
        5. After split the video we need to upload those videos to vimeo  
        after uploading take the url and upload to tracker sheet in i column(vimeo url)  
        here the project ttracker sheet

    -   Divide the components into 30 minute sprints
        
    -   Parallelly, extract the video and upload to vimeo
        


  
  **Make sure all the above points are there accordingly**
  Make sure all the above points are there accordingly

-   **Create tracker sheets :**

1 . We need to create the individual tracker sheet for each video we have divided  in Step 1 

 - After the  creation of the PPT's make sure to update those into individual trackers 

2. We have the tracker sheet template take a copy from that  
        here is the template URL

**RESTRICTED CONTENT**
  NOTE: do not edit the template take a copy of the  template  
  4. After copy the template we need to rename the tracker sheet name with the  video title name and update the component id in the  tracker sheet

**Make sure updation of all the details in the tracker main tracker as well as an individual tracker.**
 ## Create PPTs :  
1. We need to create the ppt for screenshots,marking, and animation ppt under project recreation only and create the ppts for all videos
 Here is the location(take the logins fromthe  login sheet)  
    [https://onedrive.live.com/?id=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD%21756&cid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD%21756&cid=1D5FEE4885B5AFBD) - Connect your OneDrive account  
    first, create ppts with the  following names,Each video should have the component id like` projectid-sprintid-01, 02,03 etc.`  
    _01-Scrsht-<componentID):_  
    _02-mrkScrSht-<componentID>_  
    _03-Animat-<componentID>_  
    after the ppt creation rename with component id and update the URLs inthe  trackers sheet
    

check whether the url's of each ppt is updated in each component tracker or not and project tracker too.

 - Take the screenshots

1.  Check all the screenshots by watching Vimeo video - all screenshots are there or not, is there any unnecessary screenshots are there, and check the naming of each screenshot whether is in order or not.
